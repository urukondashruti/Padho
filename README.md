# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

###

in the above project i have used React Context,React Hooks ,React-Boostrap,third-part-packages,props.
### App.js file
Imports: The code imports necessary components and modules from the React library and other custom components. It includes components like BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route from react-router-dom, as well as custom components like MainContent, Signup, Login, etc.

Component Definition: The App class is defined, extending React.Component.

State: The App component has a state that includes two properties: searchvalue and activeValue. These properties manage the search value and the active tab/section of the application, respectively.

Event Handlers: Two event handler methods are defined: onChangeActive and onchangeSearch. These methods are responsible for updating the state properties activeValue and searchvalue respectively, based on user interactions.

Render Method: The render() method renders the JSX content of the component.

Context Provider: The component wraps its JSX content inside a CoursesContext.Provider. This suggests that the application uses a context named CoursesContext to provide certain data and functions to its child components.

Routing Setup: The <BrowserRouter> component from react-router-dom is used to set up the routing functionality. Inside it, <Routes> component is used to define routes for different URLs. Each <Route> component maps a specific URL path to a corresponding component that should be rendered when the URL matches.

Route Configuration: Each <Route> component defines a specific route path using the path attribute and specifies the component that should be rendered when that route is matched using the element attribute.

Export: The App component is exported as the default export of the module, making it available for use in other parts of the application.
